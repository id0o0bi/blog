### Sailing to Byzantium [My Journey]
> W. B. Yeats, 1865 - 1939

```
That is no country for old men. The young
In one another's arms, birds in the trees
– Those dying generations – at their song,
The salmon‐falls, the mackerel‐crowded seas,
Fish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer long
Whatever is begotten, born, and dies.
Caught in that sensual music all neglect
Monuments of unageing intellect.
```

```
An aged man is but a paltry thing,
A tattered coat upon a stick, unless
Soul clap its hands and sing, and louder sing
For every tatter in its mortal dress,
Nor is there singing school but studying
Monuments of its own magnificence;
And therefore I have sailed the seas and come
To the holy city of Byzantium.
```

```
O sages standing in God's holy fire
As in the gold mosaic of a wall,
Come from the holy fire, perne in a gyre,
And be the singing‐masters of my soul.
Consume my heart away; sick with desire
And fastened to a dying animal
It knows not what it is; and gather me
Into the artifice of eternity.
```

```
Once out of nature I shall never take
My bodily form from any natural thing,
But such a form as Grecian goldsmiths make
Of hammered gold and gold enamelling
To keep a drowsy Emperor awake;
Or set upon a golden bough to sing
To lords and ladies of Byzantium
Of what is past, or passing, or to come.

并不浪漫的土耳其之旅  
诗和远方可能就这么多了吧哈哈  
临近2018的日子里，我脑中的声音不停地呼喊  
leave, be strange, and be alone.  
走吧，去做个陌生人，做个赶路的人    

老实讲，我没有想跑那么远，本来这是个40岁以后的旅行目的地  
各种机缘，年会中奖、同事提及、不想回家的春节  
也就在春节前两天的样子，办了签证，收拾行囊  
机场地铁几乎无人，回家的应该都已经在家了吧，一个个面色匆匆  

<!--
伊斯坦布尔，博斯普鲁斯海峡  
还有岸边富丽堂皇的多尔玛巴赫切宫  
以弗所，塞尔苏斯图书馆  
还有残垣断壁的圣约翰教堂  
人流如织的蓝色清真寺和大教堂  
整座城市里一日五重的高声宣礼  
时空穿越的纯真博物馆  -->
